lindsey, 

current problem. 
I have confused of how to proceed. 

1. axios vs mounting vs await fetch vs class component. This.state? 
2. where to fetch my data, 
3. get it to test or console.log
4. event handling via a button and grabbing book id. 
5. returning and rendering. 
6. I need to follow a clear easy developement process to follow. 
  a. with lots of micro steps.
